## Delivery Plan (Methodical Path)

For each page/feature we iterate in this order: page check ‚Üí page update ‚Üí page text ‚Üí page lock ‚Üí next.

Legend:
- Page check: confirm route exists and design fits system (tailwind/ui consistency)
- Page update: build/adjust UI and wire data
- Page text: finalize copy (headings, labels, empty states)
- Page lock: auth/RBAC, route guards, and QA

Planned sequence:
1) Auth flow
   - Page check: `/signin` (email magic-link)
   - Page update: ensure magic-link + error states; optional code-based OTP next
   - Page text: finalize copy, legal links
   - Page lock: redirect logged-in users away, public access only

2) Dashboard Home
   - Page check: `/` (protected)
   - Page update: show welcome, quick stats; wire any sample KPIs
   - Page text
   - Page lock: require session

3) Client Update
   - Page check: `/client-update`
   - Page update: write to `client_updates` table (Supabase)
   - Page text: helper text, success/error messages
   - Page lock: require session

4) Profile & Settings
   - Page check: `/profile`, `/settings` (if split)
   - Page update: profile fields, passwordless session management, theme toggle
   - Page text
   - Page lock: session + per-user access

5) Organization (optional, phase 2)
   - Page check: org list/members/invites
   - Page update: CRUD + roles (owner/admin/member)
   - Page text
   - Page lock: role-based access (RBAC)

6) Billing (optional, phase 2)
   - Page check: subscription plan and invoices
   - Page update: integrate provider (Stripe), display usage
   - Page text
   - Page lock: owner/admin

7) Reports/Analytics (optional, phase 2)
   - Page check: reports routes
   - Page update: charts/tables
   - Page text
   - Page lock: roles as needed

8) Polishing & Ops
   - 404/500 pages, empty states, loading skeletons
   - Accessibility, performance (bundle/code-split where needed)
   - CI/CD (Pages), custom domain, cache headers

We will track these as tasks and move page-by-page, ensuring each is checked, updated, copy-reviewed, and locked before proceeding.
